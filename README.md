Collection of custom scripts using Auto Hot Key.

I'm not a programmer (yet) but I love creating things that help me, and hopefully others, to be more efficient at daily tasks. While I am just starting the process of learning C++/C#, AHK has been tremendously helpful in utilizing a programming-type platform to create my own scripts easily and quickly.
Many of my AHK scripts are very much amateurish, my day job is 3D design and not coding after all, so if you come across a better way to do something in my code, please let me know.
